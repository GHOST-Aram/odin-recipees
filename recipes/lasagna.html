            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce 
                as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, 
                then bake until bubbly! 
                This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.
            </p>

                    <h2>Put Pasta water on to boil</h2>
                    <p>
                        Put a large pot of slated water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water) 
                        on the stovetop on high heat.
                        It can take a while for large pot of water to come to boil 
                        (This will be your extra Pasta water), so prepare the 
                        sauce in the next steps
                        while the water is heating

                    <h2>Brown the ground Beef</h2>
                    <p>
                        In a large skillet heat heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on
                        medium high heat. Add ground beef and cook

                        Add the diced pepper and onions to skillet 
                        (in the photo we are using yellow

                        Add salt to taste and note that you will later be 
                        adding Parmesan, which is salty.

                    <h2>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles</h2>
                    <p>
                        By now the salted water you started heating in 
                        step 1 should be boling. Add the dry lasagna 
                        noodles and cook them to all dente, per package directions.
                        (Note noodles may be cooked in advance)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Stir often to prevent from sticking. 
                        Make sure that water remains at full rolling boil during
                        the entire cooking to prevent noodles fron sticking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When ready to drain in  a colander and rinse with cool water,
                        gently separating any noodles that may be sticking together.

                        Spread a little olive oil on a large 
                        rimmed baking sheet and lay out the cooked noodles
                        on this sheet, turning them over so that 
                        they get coated with a little of the olive oil.
                        This is to prevent them from sticking together

                        Arrange one layer of lasagna noodles lengthwise 
                        (about 3 long noodles, edge may overlap,

                        mozzarella on top of lasagna sauce. 
                        Add half of the ricotta cheese, by placing
